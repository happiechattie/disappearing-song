# disappearing song

This project will be a website to post transient poetry. The poetry will last only as long as it stays on the page. There will be a set number of poems on the page, and as new poetry is posted, the oldest poems disappear - like writing words on a foggy glass.

## Prepare Your Environment

Install json-server to run this single page web application.

```bash
$ npm sinatll -g json-server
```

Then run the server with: 
```bash
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

This will server your code on http://localhost:3000.
