      "poemtxt": "It was many and many a year ago,\n   In a kingdom by the sea,\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\n   By the name of Annabel Lee;\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\n   Than to love and be loved by me.\n\nI was a child and she was a child,\n   In this kingdom by the sea,\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love—\n   I and my Annabel Lee—\nWith a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven\n   Coveted her and me.\n\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\n   In this kingdom by the sea,\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\n   My beautiful Annabel Lee;\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\n   And bore her away from me,\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\n   In this kingdom by the sea.\n\nThe angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\n   Went envying her and me—\nYes!—that was the reason (as all men know,\n   In this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\n   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\n\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\n   Of those who were older than we—\n   Of many far wiser than we—\nAnd neither the angels in Heaven above\n   Nor the demons down under the sea\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\n\nFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\n   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\n   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,\n   In her sepulchre there by the sea—\n   In her tomb by the sounding sea.",

      "poemtxt": "The world is too much with us; late and soon,\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\nIt moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.",
