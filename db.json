A wife that does, fixes\nsoothes, honors, obeys, Housewife,\nfishwife, bad wife, good wife, what’s\nthe word for someone who stares long\ninto the morning, unable to even fix tea\nsome days, the kettle steaming over\nloud like a train whistle, she who cries\nin the mornings, she who tears a hole\nin the earth and cannot stop grieving,\nthe one who wants to love you, but often\nisn’t good at even that, the one who\ndoesn’t want to be diminished\nby how much she wants to be yours.",

      "poemtxt": "My mother was not impressed with her beauty;\nonce a year she put it on like a costume,\nplaited her black hair, slick as cornsilk, down past her hips,\nin one rope-thick braid, turned it, carefully, hand over hand,\nand fixed it at the nape of her neck, stiff and elegant as a crown,\nwith tortoise pins, like huge insects,\nsome belonging to her dead mother,\nsome to my living grandmother.\nSitting on the stool at the mirror,\nshe applied a peachy foundation that seemed to hold her down, to trap her,\nas if we never would have noticed what flew among us unless it was weighted and bound in its mask.\nVaseline shined her eyebrows,\nmascara blackened her lashes until they swept down like feathers;\nher eyes deepened until they shone from far away.\n\nNow I remember her hands, her poor hands, which, even then were old from scrubbing,\nwhiter on the inside than they should have been,\nand hard, the first joints of her fingers, little fattened pads,\nthe nails filed to sharp points like old-fashioned ink pens,\npainted a jolly color.\nHer hands stood next to her face and wanted to be put away, prayed\nfor the scrub bucket and brush to make them useful.\nAnd, as I write, I forget the years I watched her\npull hairs like a witch from her chin, magnify\nevery blotch—as if acid were thrown from the inside.\n\nBut once a year my mother\nrose in her white silk slip,\nnot the slave of the house, the woman,\ntook the ironed dress from the hanger—\nallowing me to stand on the bed, so that\nmy face looked directly into her face,\nand hold the garment away from her\nas she pulled it down.",

She had been\nsolid as a tree,\na fur around her neck, a\nlight-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling\nmarble and passed through\nbrass openings—in 1945.\nThere was not even a black\nelevator operator at Saks.\nThe saleswoman had brought velvet\nleggings to lace me in, and cooed,\nas if in the service of all grandmothers.\nMy grandmother had smiled, but not\nhungrily, not like my mother\nwho hated them, but wanted to please,\nand they had smiled back, as if\nthey were wearing wooden collars.\nWhen my legs gave out, my grandmother\ndragged me up and held me like God\nholds saints by the\nroots of the hair. I begged her\nto believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,\nher face white\nwith sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing\naway from those eyes\nthat saw through\nher clothes, under\nher skin, all the way down\nto the transparent\ngenes confessing.",

Now here, I’m flooded\nwith flowers by cumin. Even Tarkovsky appears.\nNow I will suck you with my thumbs, mold\nyou like clay with my horns, till he’d vaporize and\nsee into what and where I’ve traveled to. Into\nhonor. Into white birch trees. Into the pouch\nused for bread. I hung around the world a lot,\nfrothily crushing the mountain range. With no\navail, with no day’s pay, sticky are my laws.\nI protected an elephant as much as I could,\nstared at the back of the horse. Joshed the others\nnow, too, tested spring mattresses. Kept\ngulping nirvana. Loosened feathery leaves,\nwrapped the emperor into a roll. To not let my\nsenses perish, to gallop without a break.",
